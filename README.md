## Structure of the repository
The repository consists of three folders:
* Task 2.1 - Unsupervised  
  There are two files inside that folder - jupyter notebook with documentation as comments and csv file with all the data used for this assignment.
* Task 2.2 - Supervised  
  This folder consists of three files - jupyter notebook, documentation and csv file with all the data used for this assignment.
* Task 2.3 - NLP

## Requirements
For running jupyter notebook files it is necessary to have **python 3** along with **pip** installed. Throughout all projects we have been using following libraries:
* sklearn
* xgboost
* pandas
* plotly
* numpy
* matplotlib  
* pycaret (for task 2.2)
* seaborn (for task 2.2)
* catboost (for task 2.2)
* pandas_profiling (for task 2.2)  
* nltk (for task 2.3)
* re (for task 2.3)
* contractions (for task 2.3) 

All those requirements are automatically installed/imported after running all cells in jupyter notebooks.
